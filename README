Embedded Linux library
======================

In order to compile the nRF24 daemon, the development version of Embedded
Linux library (ELL) needs to be available. ELL repositories can be found
here:
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/ell/ell.git
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/libs/ell/ell.git

The build system creates symbolic links to ELL sources. ELL source code
should be placed at the same top level directory as the Wireless PAN
source code:

	.
	|--- ell.git
	|    |--- ell
	|    `--- unit
	`--- iwpan.git
	     |--- src
	     `--- unit

It is not required to build or install Embedded Linux library. Wireless PAN
build is configured to build and link ELL internally.
