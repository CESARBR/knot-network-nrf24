nRF24 D-Bus API description
**************************

Service 	br.org.cesar.knot.nrf

Adapter hierarchy
=================
Interface 	br.org.cesar.knot.nrf.Adapter1
Object path 	[variable prefix]/{nrf0, nrf1, ...}

Methods 	void RemoveDevice(object device)

		Removes a remote nRF24 device including its local stored
		data such as keys, and properties.

		Returns: br.org.cesar.knot.nrf.Error.InvalidArguments


		void AddDevice(string mac)

		Adds a new nRF24 device. Allows to create a new paired device
		from external out-of-band sources.

		Returns: br.org.cesar.knot.nrf.Error.InvalidArguments


		void StartScanning(dict filter)

		This method starts the device scanning session. Device
		objects representing discovered devices are automatically
		created. Caller must use StopScanning() to release the
		session acquired.

		Returns: br.org.cesar.knot.nrf.Error.NotReady


		void StopScanning(void)

		This method releases the device scanning session.

		Returns: br.org.cesar.knot.nrf.Error.NotReady
			br.org.cesar.knot.nrf.Error.NotAutorized


Properties 	string Address [readonly]

		Persistent property. 64-bit nRF24 address.
		eg: 88:77:66:55:44:33:22:11 (MSB on left)


		boolean Powered [readwrite]

		Not persistent property. Switch Switch nRF24 adapter on/off



Device hierarchy
================
Interface 	br.org.cesar.knot.nrf.Device1
Object path 	[variable prefix]/{nrf0, nrf1, ...}/dev_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx


Methods 	void Pair(dict properties)

		This method allows to create persistent association. Allowed
		properties: "PublicKey", "PrivateKey". Keys are optional,
		binding without keys results on open physical channel.

		Returns: br.org.cesar.knot.nrf.Error.AlreadyExists
			br.org.cesar.knot.nrf.Error.InvalidArguments


Properties 	string Address [readonly]

		64-bit nRF24 address.
		eg: 88:77:66:55:44:33:22:11 (MSB on left)

		uint64 Id [readonly]

		Unique identification exposed to service level. Technology
		agnostic value to allow mapping a virtual device representation
		to its actual device.

		string Name [readonly, optional]

		nRF24 remote name. PropertiesChanged is be emitted if this
		value changes.


		string PublicKey [writeonly]

		Remote's public key that can be set to enable a secure
		channel between peers.


		boolean Connected [readonly]

		Indicates if the remote is currently connected.
		PropertiesChanged signal is emitted when this value
		changes.

		boolean Paired [readonly]

		Indicates if the remote is paired.


		object Adapter [readonly]

		Object path of the nRF24 adapter associated with this device.
